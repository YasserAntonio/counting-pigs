# Pigs counting

This repo is a official implementation of ["Towards perspective-free object counting with deep learning"](http://agamenon.tsc.uah.es/Investigacion/gram/publications/eccv2016-onoro.pdf) on object counting with deep learning based on gramuah's code [ccnn](https://github.com/gramuah/ccnn).
Many thanks to  Daniel Oñoro-Rubio and Roberto J. López-Sastre for their codes.

## Introduction

Based on this code, it is improved to make it more suitable for pig counts.
We have provided the test code, you can test it directly, and all the code will be published after the article is published
